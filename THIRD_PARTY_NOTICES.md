# Third-Party Notices

AISimulate contains source material derived from the projects identified below.
These notices apply only to the identified third-party material. Dependencies
installed separately by package managers are governed by the license material
distributed with those packages.

Unless otherwise stated, AISimulate file paths in this document are relative
to `python/aisimulate/` in the repository source tree.

## AIConfigurator

The repository-root `.coderabbit.yaml` is adapted and modified from
AIConfigurator's `.coderabbit.yaml` at commit
`13b5cf2697876692b0a52098266c81162add11fc`. The original imported policy is
preserved at `python/aisimulate/.coderabbit.yaml` as migration provenance.

The 18 B200 TensorRT-LLM 1.3.0rc20 performance tables under
`src/aisimulate_core/systems/data/b200_sxm/*/trtllm/1.3.0rc20/` include
power measurements derived from AIConfigurator commit
`915f590680d8a79fe9c39f6f3a9ff13bc267fcce` (PR #1584). Fourteen tables remain
unmodified, byte-identical copies after the September 17-18 refresh. The
context-MLA table was replaced with locally collected measurements, and the
MoE table has locally refreshed MXFP4 rows with unavailable-power sentinels.
The context-attention and
generation-attention tables are modified derivatives: AISimulate preserves
newer local timing rows and adds the typed `0.0` / `0.0` unavailable sentinel
to those local-only identities. Source paths, row counts, measured coverage,
and merge details are recorded in
`src/aisimulate_core/systems/data/b200_sxm/README.md`. The two unmodified
upstream attention copies under
`src/aisimulate_core/systems/data/b200_sxm/power_upstream/` support focused
import regression tests, which pin source and packaged SHA-256 digests.

The corresponding energy expectations in the repository-root file
`crates/core/parity_tests/perfmodel/goldens/per_op.json` are modified generated
derivatives of those measurements. AISimulate's native pinning workflow at
commit `36dcc8f3afe9e6e2e9de976737b6337fad8c4d74` produced the two case updates;
the adjacent parity README records the reviewed energy-only delta.

## Dynamo V4.1 FPM collection adapter

`collector/fpm_forward/runtime/dsv41/dsv41_scheduler.py` is modified code
adapted from `components/src/dynamo/vllm/instrumented_scheduler.py` in
https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/54960177085413259859c88bd34ed0734d4c2ea9.
It adds bounded same-request real-KV collection while preserving the native
benchmark and FPM contracts. Copyright (c) 2025-2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION &
AFFILIATES. All rights reserved. Licensed under Apache-2.0; the upstream
license is preserved in the adapter's adjacent `LICENSE`. The adjacent README
records the inspected vLLM API revision and immutable runtime image/source
hashes. vLLM implementation files are not vendored. The text fixture and
lifecycle tests are original work for this change, with no external corpus.

## NVIDIA AIConfigurator speculative decoding

The speculation SDK, compatibility exports, CLI/task integration, attention and whole-forward FPM operation changes, native bindings, and their tests are adapted and modified from AIConfigurator PR #1563, pinned at commit `6290c161a354da5250c391bd43372b2e9c6f4a51`. Original paths are under `aic-core/src/aiconfigurator_core/sdk/`, `src/aiconfigurator/`, `aic-core/rust/aiconfigurator-core/`, `aic-core/rust/tests/public-api/`, and `tests/`.

Derived AISimulate paths are under `python/aisimulate/src/aisimulate_core/sdk/`, `python/aisimulate/src/aisimulate/sdk/speculation/`, `python/aisimulate/src/aisimulate_core/sdk/speculation/`, `python/aisimulate/src/aisimulate/legacy_cli/`, `python/aisimulate/src/aisimulate/sdk/{speculative,task_v2}.py`, and `python/aisimulate/tests/`; repository-root Rust paths are under `crates/core/src/perfmodel/`, `crates/core/parity_tests/perfmodel/`, and `crates/tests/public-api/`. The repository's [synchronization provenance](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aisimulate/blob/main/docs/ci/aic-sync.md#source-provenance) records import boundaries and links the current path mapping. Changes preserve AISimulate's current native contracts and strengthen configuration validation and regression coverage.

## NVIDIA Dynamo Weka regression provenance

The `weka_seam_rekey_never_uses_a_future_parent` regression in repository-root
`crates/core/src/replay/loadgen/weka.rs` is adapted and modified from NVIDIA
Dynamo's `lib/mocker/src/loadgen/tests.rs` at immutable commit
`b113ceae74da3f6754429ade750b0f5b0c8de5d6`. The adaptation uses AISimulate's public
graph loader and adds assertions that the later continuation was selected while
the earlier fork retains its original parent.

## SGLang feed-forward/decode composition and quantization exclusions

The dense-prefix composition and exclusion resolver in `src/aisimulate_core/sdk/models/deepseek_v32.py` and their regression fixtures in `tests/unit/sdk/models/test_deepseek_v32_dense.py` and `tests/unit/sdk/models/test_large_ep_model_graphs.py` adapt and modify the tensor-parallel communication and packed-linear selection behavior from SGLang revision `02c5a855aceb968c310e6fbc6632270e26edc84b`. Original source paths are `python/sglang/srt/models/deepseek_v2.py`, `python/sglang/srt/layers/communicator.py`, `python/sglang/srt/layers/quantization/modelopt_quant.py`, and `python/sglang/srt/layers/quantization/utils.py`. The adaptation models operator composition and projection precision without importing the serving runtime or its GPU dependencies.

The vLLM copyright in `src/aisimulate_core/sdk/models/deepseek_v32.py` is retained from those SGLang sources. At the pinned SGLang revision, the header of `python/sglang/srt/models/deepseek_v2.py` identifies its own upstream as [`vllm/model_executor/models/deepseek_v2.py` at vLLM commit `fb6af8bc086328ca6659e72d11ffd4309ce4de22`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/fb6af8bc086328ca6659e72d11ffd4309ce4de22/vllm/model_executor/models/deepseek_v2.py), licensed under Apache-2.0. This records the inherited attribution chain; the SGLang revision above is the source adapted for AISimulate.

The scoped GLM-5.2 NVFP4 Rubin decode composition helper in the same model file, its fixtures in `tests/unit/sdk/models/test_sglang_rubin_decode_composition.py`, and the three-operation oracle in repository-root `crates/core/src/perfmodel/engine/runtime.rs` also adapt and modify the embedding reduction, post-join routed/shared expert addition and terminal residual RMSNorm inventory from that revision. Original source paths are `python/sglang/srt/layers/vocab_parallel_embedding.py:566–579`, `python/sglang/srt/models/deepseek_v2.py:1009–1030,2906–2910`, and `python/sglang/srt/layers/quantization/mxfp4_flashinfer_trtllm_moe.py:374–406`. This composition applies to the existing TP4 collection/serving contract with `SGLANG_ENABLE_MOE_DEFERRED_FINALIZE=0`, although the image default is true, and inactive embedding replication/shared-expert-TP1. It uses existing analytical BF16 memory operations and all-reduce measurements; native operation implementations are not copied into execution and no native latency for the new terms is claimed.

The grouped-cache config derivation and metadata regression tests in
`src/aisimulate/support/config_profile.py`,
`tests/unit/test_support_config_profile.py`, and
`tests/unit/test_support_topology.py` are adapted and modified from vLLM's

AISimulate modifies these contracts for metadata-only rank-local aggregate
cache sizing and validation, without constructing runtime tensors or a model.
The derived tests use original synthetic geometries and do not copy a
checkpoint fixture. The derived files retain the upstream copyright and

      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## SGLang DeepSeek-V4.1 serving contracts

The V4.1 execution and performance-model logic in
`src/aisimulate_core/sdk/deepseek_v41.py`, `sdk/models/deepseek_v41.py`
(with the same `src/aisimulate_core/` prefix), and repository-root
`crates/core/src/perfmodel/operators/dsv41.rs` is informed by and modified from
SGLang's serving architecture at immutable commit
`1aa0e962b206102b7c439a4a0c4981cfec6e87bc`:

- `python/sglang/srt/models/deepseek_v4.py` and `deepseek_v2.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/layers/engram.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/layers/attention/dsv4/compressor.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/layers/attention/dsv4/dsv41_sparse.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/layers/attention/deepseek_v4_backend.py`
- `python/sglang/srt/mem_cache/deepseek_v4_memory_pool.py`
- `python/sglang/kernels/ops/attention/dsv4_attn_metadata_kernels.py`
- `python/sglang/kernels/ops/attention/dsv4/sm90_fp4_indexer.py`
- `python/sglang/benchmark/one_batch.py`

The original integration adapter
`collector/sglang/dsv41_native_runner.py` calls that pinned benchmark's model
builder and request lifecycle. Its component boundaries are modified from
the serving contracts above; it does not copy framework metadata builders.
The original attention-only adapter `collector/sglang/dsv41_attention_runner.py`,
its `tests/unit/collector/test_dsv41_attention.py` fixtures and the attention
section of `collector/sglang/README.dsv41.md` also adapt those API boundaries
(modified), including native dummy-loader post-load order from
`python/sglang/srt/model_loader/loader.py` and random initialization from
`python/sglang/srt/model_loader/weight_utils.py` at the same immutable revision.
They call native attention, pool and request builders; they do not copy those
implementations or represent the isolated stack as the complete model.
The matching loaded-dimension guards in `collector/sglang/dsv41_contract.py`
and their CPU fixtures in `tests/unit/collector/test_dsv41_contract.py` are
modified analytical adaptations of the indexer layout in `dsv41_sparse.py`.
The SM90 index-score arithmetic and query-width formulas in
`crates/core/src/perfmodel/operators/dsv41.rs`, their Rust regression tests,
and `docs/perf-model/models/deepseek-v41.md` are independently expressed, modified
analytical adaptations of those same pinned BF16 indexer contracts.

The measured operator databases and adjacent documentation under
`src/aisimulate_core/systems/profiles/dsv41/` contain AISimulate timings
and geometry adapted from the same serving contracts (modified). Their
README and adjacent provenance identify the immutable collection runtime
and source identities. The restored GB300 tables preserve their historical
timings and documented source-audited indexer metadata correction. The
B300 TP4 and TP2 tables are new native measurements with loaded-module dimension
validation; they do not inherit that historical correction.

The FPM table execution identities, geometry, collection sidecars and accompanying
README under `src/aisimulate_core/systems/profiles/dsv41_fpm/`, including
B300 TP2/TP4 and GB300 TP2 full/bounded measurements, are modified AISimulate
adaptations of the SGLang serving-contract paths and immutable commit
listed above (Copyright 2023-2024 SGLang Team and SGLang contributors,
Apache-2.0), and of `config.json`, `inference/model.py` and
`DeepSeek_V41_Tech_Report.pdf` from
`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash@fb2764a5cf321eaa5070ca8f9e892818f477c16d`
(Copyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek, MIT; source and license below). The latencies are
new AISimulate measurements; these files contain no upstream model execution
code. The SGLang source revision identifies the serving-contract reference,
not the entire measured runtime image; the immutable image and captured source
identities remain collection provenance.

Copyright 2023-2024 SGLang Team and SGLang contributors. Licensed under Apache-2.0; its terms are
reproduced in the repository `LICENSE`. These are analytical adaptations,
not a copy of the model execution implementation. The modified analytical
scoring/storage adaptations and their independently written regression cases
also appear in `python/aisimulate/tests/unit/sdk/models/test_deepseek_v41.py`,
Rust operator/spec unit tests, `docs/perf-model/models/deepseek-v41.md`. They distinguish candidate masking from scoring
and physical FlashMLA cache payload from logical FP4 values.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## vLLM Kimi KDA state sizing

`src/aisimulate_core/sdk/state_memory.py` and the cache-dtype controls in
`src/aisimulate/config/engine.py` are adapted and modified from vLLM commit
`a474da28131f61684849b31e29af0eebaaedc383`. Original paths:
`vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/mamba_utils.py`,

`vllm/v1/attention/backends/mla/triton_mla.py`, and `vllm/config/cache.py`.
The modified implementation reuses AISimulate's Kimi model for token KV geometry,
resolves the requested block granularity to fit one state using CPU arithmetic,
and adds AISimulate validation and diagnostics.
